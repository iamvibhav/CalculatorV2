# Simple Calculator
This repository contains a simple calculator application developed during my internship at Oasis Infobyte. The calculator is capable of performing basic mathematical operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This hands-on project significantly enhanced my development skills and deepened my understanding of programming concepts.
